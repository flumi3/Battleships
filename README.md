# Battleships

This is a university project of a Battleships game created in the 3rd semester of my Computer Science bachelor's degree in collaboration with 3 fellow students.

The project was built using Java (and JavaFX), allowing for the following features:
- Play against a computer player
- Play online against another player using web sockets
- Save a game on the local computer

I was mainly responsible for setting up the basic project structure and everything related to UI/UX.
